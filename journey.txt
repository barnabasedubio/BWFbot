How I created a scalable, stateful, telegram bot application

* unlike regular web applications where state is handled in the server
* or SPAs where the state is handled in the browser (vuex)
* telegram bots are completely stateless

question: How can I build a fitness tracking application on telegram that can handle a bunch of users?
solution: by creating my own state and using Redis as state management




---- launch update -----
15:30 - 0 signups (except for me, duh)

16:00 
just launched mybwf 1 hour ago. already 13 users. I feel great but holy shit im scared wtf
being exposed to the public and finally "launching" feels surreal
but the response has been great so far! Amazing community

Always when I get a new message on reddit i'm scared that something might not be working

17:00 - 21 signups
17:15 - 27 signups
17:30 - 33 signups
17:50 - 50 signups, bot has stopped responding and idk why fuck my life
17:53 - it works again. I think the issue is that if one user has slow internet, everybody else has to wait for that

18:05 - not responding again fuuuck

18:07 - 57 signups, still no response locally
next time set up real time logging
its gonna be a long night...

18:30 - inbound bandwidth is through the roof, i need to somehow clear the message queue on the webhook endpoint, aiohttp cant handle so much
is my guess rn
19:13 - added print statements, rebuilt and relaunched container, works for me now. Docker is a fucking godsend
19:13 - 103 signups

the app is so incredibly buggy its ridiculous. I just got the confirmation for the creation of SOMEBODY ELSE'S workout. Luckily it was just a message
and not an actual DB call. the person should have gotten their workout just fine (i hope)
adding exercises doesnt seem to work, and every message after then is read as a callback message

Note to self: There are some bugs that can only reveal themselves if you have concurrent usage of your application.

20:10 - UID bug: due to async it's possible that I set the UID for user a, and while handling request for user a
set the UID for user b before the user a handle is complete, which causes the bot to send the message / data to another user. this is not good. at all.

20:40 - 146 signups
I am going to work on a change that sets the UID to be local all the time. Thing is, I won't be able to test it right now. It's goin straight to prod
I know what youre thinking, but my foot has been shot open at this point. another bullet wont do too much anyway

20:50
will not perform the change because the scope is too large to deploy without at least some local testing first

21:00 - 150 signups
Never thought it would be this much in a matter of hours. Just ordered some good fucking food.

21:50 - 184 signups

22:00 - container is throwing weird exceptions but luckily it keeps restarting. I hope it doesn't impact the users that experienced the mistake too much...

22:10 - reason for the exceptions was that my middleware didnt handle for non text messages (gifs, stickers etc). Handled it and redeployed. It's amazing that a redeploy
has virtually zero downtime thanks to docker 

22:30 - this is one of many many many products i am going to launch. Of course it's not perfect, but I have learned a great deal!! It's only gonna get better from here
next steps: proper logging, error reporting, and analytics

22:55 - 225 signups
biggest thing I need to fix (will do when they are all asleep): when removing inline replies and sending edited text, if telegram throws a web error, handle for that

23:30 - Telegram thinks I am someone else. whaaat theee fuckkkk

23:40 shutting the bot down for a bit while I do some debugging
note to self: always create an additional bot for testing purposes.

01:10 - just did away with the global uid and replaced it with local uids. It should be much more robust now.

01:50 - 298 signups
01:55 - THIS! IS! SPARTA!

02:30 - continues to be stable. I'm going to bed now. Was an exciting day, I don't think I'll ever forget it.

13:05 - 496 signups
13:05 - still pretty robust, havent yet gotten any issues. Some weird things going on when the program tries to remove previous inline replies, but the bot is as responsive
as ever and does not hang anymore (knock on wood)
