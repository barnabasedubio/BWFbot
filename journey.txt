How I created a semi-scalable, stateful, telegram bot application

* unlike regular web applications where state is handled in the server
* or SPAs where the state is handled in the browser (vuex)
* telegram bots are completely stateless

question: How can I build a fitness tracking application on telegram that can handle a bunch of users?
solution: by creating my own state and state management system
